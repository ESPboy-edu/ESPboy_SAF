- Add signal (kill) handling?
- Add "contain source code" feature that would include the game's own source
  code in the binary and possibly print it in console on demand?
- Create a small web "IDE" using a C interpreter (e.g. picoc) compiled to JS
  via emscripten.
- Add FORCE_GRAYSCALE?
- Create a script that merges multiple programs into one program with menu
  allowing to run any of these programs.
- Possibly implement the interface in another language(s), it could then be
  possible to transpile from other languages to C (dynamic typing is a problem
  though). Check out:
  - ts2c: JS -> C
  - wax: nice tiny lang -> basically anything including C
  - cython: Python -> C
- Test programs:
  - something aka oblivion face creation :)
  - pok√©mon-like walk simulator
- Refactor all frontends.
- chess colors: 9191aa, b6b6aa, 6ddaaa, da9155

DONE:
- multiple minigames in one (snake, mines, ...)
- Port micro TD to this
- Create a small 1bit logo and add it to the library.
- Port to plain X11?
- Add demo record feature to some frontends.
- Add pause button to frontends.
- Add joyhat support to pokitto
- Add time slowdown option for PC.
- SDL_PLAIN frontend
- Port anarch to this.
- Add fast version for common image drawing modes (i.e. no transform no scale
  should be faster than the general version).
- Add screenshot taking key to SDL.
- Add feature that measures the execution time of one loop step, for performance
  measurement.
- Create a platform testing program.
- Check/improve the random function (try to apply my custom randomness checking
  algorithm).
- Remove SAF_randomize and leave that for an extension? It makes programs
  non-deterministic. Instead add SAF_seed.
- Shift responsibility for save/load optimization from fontends to SAF, will be
  probably better
- Make the demo replay also usable as a save/load feature (i.e. loading will
  replay all inputs to get you into the same position).
